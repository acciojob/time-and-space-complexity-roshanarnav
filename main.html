	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the size of the input to the program. The time complexity of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the string representing the input: the time complexity is a function f(n), where n is the size of the input. It's important for the algorithms to be efficient.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is a concept in computer science that deals with the amount of memory (space) taken by an algorithm to run. The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. For instance, an algorithm with space complexity O(n) requires space proportional to the size of the input.</p>
