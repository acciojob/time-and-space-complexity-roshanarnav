	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1> 
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the length of the input. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, meaning they take less time to execute for larger inputs.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the length of the input. An algorithm with space complexity O(n) uses memory that grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
